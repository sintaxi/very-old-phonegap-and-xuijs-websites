<h2>A simple javascript framework for building mobile web applications.</h2>

<div id="why">
  <h3>WHY?!</h3>

  <p>We hear your words. <em>Why another JavaScript framework?!</em> When development of PhoneGap was under way we noticed slow
  load times for modern JavaScript frameworks (such as Prototype, MooTools, YUI, Ext and (yes) even jQuery. 
  A big reason why these libraries are so big is because  is mostly they contain a great deal of cross browser 
  compatability code. The mobile space has less browser implementations (so far) and different needs. Thus XUI.</p>
</div>

<p>XUI strives to be a framework for first class mobile device browsers such as WebKit, Fennec and Opera with future 
support under consideration for IE Mobile and BlackBerry.</p>
