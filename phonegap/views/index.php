        <p>"AIR for the iPhone" because this nice little hack, first created at an 
          iPhone BarCamp, wraps the Web view with a container. This container gives 
          the view access to APIs available on the device, that may not be available 
          yet via WebKit alone."</p>

        <p>"PhoneGaps lets developers wrap web applications inside a native application 
          using WebKit, making development easier for those who aren't familiar with 
          Objective-C and Cocoa. In fact, the framework even includes a tool for easily 
          doing this type of "native web app" packaging. And if a native web app wrapper 
          sounds like it would be right up your alley, you can download PhoneGap for 
          free and give it a whirl."</p>

        <p>"There is no doubt that developers are coming from far and wide to write iPhone 
          applications. While some are coming from household names Mac users have come 
          to know and love, others are coming from developers who have never laid hands 
          on a Mac before. However, regardless of background, sometimes, learning a whole 
          new programming language can be a tall order. Enter <strong>PhoneGap</strong>."</p>

          gave 60 second pitches. By vote of applause and cheering, the winning pitch was 
          <strong>PhoneGap</strong>, presented by Andre Charland of Nitobi."</p>

        <p>"You can get most of the benefits of an iPhone application without writing a 
          single line of Objective C. An open source project called <strong>PhoneGap</strong> lets your 
          wrap your website in iPhone App goodness. And you can even charge for your 
          creation. Even more exciting than being able to easily create an app is getting 
          access to some native iPhone APIs."</p>
